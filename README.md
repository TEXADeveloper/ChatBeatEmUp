A Beat Em Up to work with twitch chat

  
  

To make it work on your editor, you'll have to create a StreamerData.cs class inside the "Data" folder and then write:

  

	

    public static class StreamerData
    
    {
    
    	public static string username = ""; // the name of your account
    
    	public static string password = ""; // the oauth token of your account
    
    }
